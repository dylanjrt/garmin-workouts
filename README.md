## Key Tips for 10km Success

1. **Pacing is everything** - Start conservatively. The first 2km should feel easy.

2. **Practice nutrition** - For swims over 2 hours, you need to eat/drink. Practice this in training.

3. **Sighting** - Practice lifting your head to sight without breaking rhythm.

4. **Mental game** - Break the race into chunks (10 x 1km feels easier than 1 x 10km).

5. **Consistency beats intensity** - Showing up 4x/week beats crushing yourself 2x/week.
